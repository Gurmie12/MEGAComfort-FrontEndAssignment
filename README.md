Use "npm install" to install all dependencies

The checkout form is found at localhost:3000/sale



The Employee sales form is found at localhost:3000/form



*** If initial 'npm start' results in an error, clean the npm cache with "npm cache clean --force" and delete the "node_modules" folder along with the "package-lock.json" file and run "npm install". once all of the files are re-installed, run "npm start" again and the issue should be fixed. ***
